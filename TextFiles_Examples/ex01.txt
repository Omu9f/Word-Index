Description

Life restoration of Sarcosuchus imperator
Sarcosuchus was a giant relative of crocodiles, with 
fully grown individuals estimated to have reached up 
to 9 to 9.5 m (29.5 to 31.2 ft) in total length and 3.5 
to 4.3 metric tons (3.9 to 4.7 short tons) in weight.[1] 
It had somewhat telescoped eyes and a long snout 
comprising 75% of the length of the skull. There were 
35 teeth in each side of the upper jaw, while in the 
lower jaw there were 31 teeth in each side. The upper 
jaw was also noticeably longer than the lower one 
leaving a gap between them when the jaws were shut, 
creating an overbite. In young individuals the shape 
of the snout resembled that of the living gharial but 
in fully grown individuals it 
became considerably broader.[2][3]

Bulla
Sarcosuchus has an expansion at the end of its 
snout known as a bulla, which has been compared 
with the ghara seen in gharials. However, unlike 
the ghara, which is only found in male gharial, 
the bulla is present in all Sarcosuchus skulls that 
have been found so far, suggesting that it was 
not a sexually dimorphic trait. The purpose of 
this structure is not known.

Osteoderms

Scutes of S. imperator
The osteoderms, also known as dermal scutes, of 
Sarcosuchus were similar to those goniopholodids 
like Sunosuchus and Goniopholis; they formed an 
uninterrupted surface that started in the posterior 
part of the neck up to the middle of the tail 
like is seen in Araripesuchus and other basal 
crocodyliforms, different from the pattern seen 
in living crocodiles, which present discontinuity 
between the osteoderms of the neck and body.[2]

Size

A common method to estimate the size of 
crocodiles and crocodile-like reptiles is 
the use of the length of the skull measured 
in the midline from the tip of the snout to 
the back of the skull table,[2] since in living 
crocodilians there is a strong correlation between 
skull length and total body length in subadult and 
adult individuals irrespective of their sex,[4] 
this method was used by Sereno et al. (2001) for 
Sarcosuchus due to the absence of a complete enough 
skeleton. Two regression equations were used to 
estimate the size of S. imperator, they were created 
based on measurements gathered from 17 captive gharial 
individuals from northern India and from 28 wild 
saltwater crocodile individuals from northern Australia,[2] 
both datasets supplemented by available measurements of 
individuals over 1.5 m (4.92 ft) in length found in the 
literature.[2][5] The largest known skull of S. imperator 
(the type specimen) is 1.6 m (5.25 ft) long (1.5 m (4.92 ft) 
in the midline), and it was estimated that the individual 
it belonged to had a total body length of 11.65 m (38.2 ft),
[2] its snout-vent length of 5.7 m (18.7 ft) was estimated 
using linear equations for the saltwater crocodile[6] and 
in turn this measurement was used to estimate its body 
weight at 8 metric tons (8.8 short tons).[2] This shows that 
Sarcosuchus was able to reach a maximum body size not only 
greater than previously estimated[2] but also greater than 
that of the Miocene Rhamphosuchus,[7] the Late Cretaceous 
Deinosuchus[8][9] and the Miocene Purussaurus[10] according 
to current estimates at that time.

However, extrapolation from the femur of a subadult 
individual as well as measurements of the skull width 
further showed that the largest S. imperator was significantly 
smaller than was estimated by Sereno et al. (2001) based on 
modern crocodilians. O’Brien et al. (2019) estimated the length 
of the largest S. imperator specimen at 9.5 m (31 ft) and body 
weight at 4.3 metric tons (4.7 short tons) based on longirostrine 
crocodylians skull width to total length ratio. This estimate is 
very close to the femur based estimate (9.1 m (29.9 ft)).[1]

Classification

Sarcosuchus is commonly classified as part of the clade Pholidosauridae,[2][11][12] 
a group of crocodile-like reptiles (Crocodyliformes) related but outside Crocodylia 
(the clade containing living crocodiles, alligators and gharials).[2] Within this group 
it is most closely related to the North American genus Terminonaris.[2] Most members of 
Pholidosauridae had long, slender snouts and they all were aquatic, inhabiting several 
different environments, some forms are interpreted as marine, capable of tolerating 
saltwater while others, like Sarcosuchus, were freshwater forms, the most primitive 
members of the clade, however, were found in coastal settings, zones of mixing of 
freshwater and marine waters.[12] Sarcosuchus stands out among pholidosaurids for 
being considered a generalist predator, different from most known members of the clade 
which were specialized piscivores.[2] A 2019 study found it to be in a more derived position 
in Tethysuchia, being phylogenetically closer to Dyrosauridae.[13]
